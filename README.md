# programming-wisdom
Programming wisdom from around the web.

## Rules
Webpages must be 

1. **Programming-related**
2. **Language/platform/etc agnostic** with the exception of some somewhat ubiquitous things like regex and SQL
2. **Timeless**
3. **Respectful**
4. **Educational**

Opinions pieces are fine, but should be thoughtful and sufficiently explained. Also, opinions in these webpages are not necessarily those of contributors to this list or their respective employers. Put another way, additions to this list are not endorsements of any particular opinion.
